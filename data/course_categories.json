This online course will introduce you to the principles of object-oriented programming in Python, showing you how to create objects, functions, methods, and classes. You’ll use what you learn to create your own text-based adventure game. You will have the chance to share your code with other learners, and see theirs. If you’re an educator, you’ll also be able to develop ideas for using object-oriented programming in your classroom.        ",
